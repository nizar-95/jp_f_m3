      "literature related to the social and economic impli cations of online platforms (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. \n",
      "2003; Chan and Ghose 2014; Zhang and Liu 2012) by s hedding light on whether hiring biases prevail in \n",
      "online labor markets. The awareness of stereotyping  behavior in online hiring decisions allows policy \n",
      "makers and platform owners to gain macroOlevel insi ghts towards the need for specialized policies and \n",
      "guidelines to regulate these online markets.  \n",
      "Second, by demonstrating the nature of gender stere otypes in online markets, our study illustrates the  \n",
      "important point of whether outcomes in online conte xts are consistent with that from the traditional \n",
      "marketplaces (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000; Ch ellappa et al. 2011). Not only does this finding ha ve \n",
      "crucial implications towards policy design, it also  serves to benefit managers and employers at the mi croO\n",

      "from the study findings by taking steps to rectify the undue biases that are imposed on them in online  \n",
      "settings.  \n",
      "Third, we attempt to provide deeper insights into t his phenomenon by unraveling the specific condition s \n",
      "under which gender stereotypes will have a stronger  impact on hiring outcomes. The moderating effect o f \n",

      "hiring outcomes. Past work has largely relied on au dit and correspondence studies to examine the exten t \n",

      "Online labor marketplaces have grown rapidly in rec ent years. The industry has experienced a great \n",
      "increase in both the number of participants and tra nsaction volume. Over the last four years, workers on \n",
      "Elance and oDesk have earned close to $2 billion th rough over 8 million jobs posted on these online \n",
      "platforms. 1 On oDesk alone, the number of employers billing on  the site has increased by over 800% \n",
      "between 2009 and 2013, accounting for almost a 900%  gain in quarterly wage bill (Agrawal et al. 2013).  \n",
      "Not only do these online platforms serve as an inte rmediary for the buyers and providers of labor, the y \n",
      "also host a myriad of jobs ranging from software an d web development to administrative support and \n",
      "multimedia design, which in turn, attracts and reta ins a large pool of global workers. It is projected  that \n",
      "online labor marketplaces will grow to a $5 billion  industry by 2018. 2 Given the enormous scale of the \n",
      "online labor market, hiring decisions made by onlin e employers have significant social and economic \n",
      "consequences, as these actions implicate the income s of millions of workers worldwide. In particular, it is \n",
      "imperative to understand whether online workers are  being treated fairly in terms of job opportunities  \n",
      "awarded and how discriminatory biases, if any, affe ct the hiring decisions made by online employers. \n",
      "Job discrimination pertains to the phenomenon where  groups of workers are denied access, or have \n",
      "limited access to jobs. Workers can be discriminate d based on innate attributes such as gender, race, \n",
      "disability or age that are unrelated to worker prod uctivity (Arrow 1973). Discriminatory hiring is an issue \n",
      "of concern not only because it results in the ineff icient allocation of resources, it also contributes  to \n",
      "inequitable distribution of wealth and income among  the population. As such, regulations and legislati ons \n",
      "such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (US) and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975  (UK) are erected to \n",
      "prevent market failures that arise from discriminat ory labor practices. While governmental interventio ns \n",
      "are in place to protect against unfair treatment of  workers in traditional labor markets, these laws l apse in \n",
      "their coverage for online platforms due to the cros sOnational nature of working relationships forged i n \n",
      "these marketplaces. Greater awareness and better un derstanding of the hiring practices in online labor  \n",
      "markets is a necessary first step for deriving effe ctive policy interventions to address the inadequac ies of \n",
      "existing antiOdiscriminatory laws. \n",
      "While extant studies on online labor markets have f ocused on the reputational signals (Lin and Goes 20 12; \n",

      "bidding strategies (Hong et al. 2013; Snir and Hitt  2003) of workers, we attempt to examine a more \n",
      "fundamental aspect of worker characteristics in thi s nascent labor marketplace. In particular, we aim to \n",
      "assess whether worker’s gender can lead to hiring b iases, and how gender stereotypes can affect the hi ring \n",
      "decisions in online labor markets. Gender stereotyp es create a predisposition towards negativity that \n",

      "Elance and oDesk have earned close to $2 billion th rough over 8 million jobs posted on these online \n",
      "platforms. 1 On oDesk alone, the number of employers billing on  the site has increased by over 800% \n",
      "between 2009 and 2013, accounting for almost a 900%  gain in quarterly wage bill (Agrawal et al. 2013).  \n",
      "Not only do these online platforms serve as an inte rmediary for the buyers and providers of labor, the y \n",

      "multimedia design, which in turn, attracts and reta ins a large pool of global workers. It is projected  that \n",
      "online labor marketplaces will grow to a $5 billion  industry by 2018. 2 Given the enormous scale of the \n",
      "online labor market, hiring decisions made by onlin e employers have significant social and economic \n",
      "consequences, as these actions implicate the income s of millions of workers worldwide. In particular, it is \n",
      "imperative to understand whether online workers are  being treated fairly in terms of job opportunities  \n",
      "awarded and how discriminatory biases, if any, affe ct the hiring decisions made by online employers. \n",
      "Job discrimination pertains to the phenomenon where  groups of workers are denied access, or have \n",
      "limited access to jobs. Workers can be discriminate d based on innate attributes such as gender, race, \n",
      "disability or age that are unrelated to worker prod uctivity (Arrow 1973). Discriminatory hiring is an issue \n",
      "of concern not only because it results in the ineff icient allocation of resources, it also contributes  to \n",
      "inequitable distribution of wealth and income among  the population. As such, regulations and legislati ons \n",
      "such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (US) and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975  (UK) are erected to \n",
      "prevent market failures that arise from discriminat ory labor practices. While governmental interventio ns \n",
      "are in place to protect against unfair treatment of  workers in traditional labor markets, these laws l apse in \n",
      "their coverage for online platforms due to the cros sOnational nature of working relationships forged i n \n",
      "these marketplaces. Greater awareness and better un derstanding of the hiring practices in online labor  \n",
      "markets is a necessary first step for deriving effe ctive policy interventions to address the inadequac ies of \n",
      "existing antiOdiscriminatory laws. \n",
